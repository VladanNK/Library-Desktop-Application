The application has its database modeled in MySQL with all necessary tables. It is necessary to first start the local server through XAMP and then open the Backend folder, called "Biblioteka" and start the server written in the Java programming language using the Spring framework. Finally, a project called "BibliotekaInterface" is started, where the Main class is found and the program starts, where a user interface will appear where any operation can be performed with the database (create, read, update or delete). The JavaFX framework is used for the entire user interface. In the upper left corner is the symbol for selecting the table, as well as on the initial screen where the desired menu is selected.
